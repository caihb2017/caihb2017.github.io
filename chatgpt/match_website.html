成功率和结婚概率\n\n1. **总体成功率**：\n   - 根据Pew Research Center的研究，大约10%的配对伴侣（包括已婚、同居或长期关系的伴侣）是通过约会网站或应用程序认识的【33†source】。\n   - Tinder用户中，有一些确实通过该平台找到了长期伴侣或结婚对象，但具体的结婚概率没有明确的统计数据。\n\n2. **用户体验**：\n   - Pew Research Center的数据显示，使用约会应用程序的人中，大约53%的人报告称他们的总体体验是积极的【33†source】。\n   - 在支付使用这些平台的用户中，58%的人表示他们的个人经历是积极的【33†source】。\n\n3. **具体平台的影响**：\n   - Tinder作为一种主要的约会平台，其用户群体中很多是年轻人，目标往往是短期约会和社交，而不是寻找长期关系或结婚【32†source】【33†source】。\n   - Bumble和Hinge等其他平台可能在帮助用户建立更长久关系方面表现更好。例如，Hinge声称其目标是帮助用户找到长期伴侣，而不仅仅是约会【31†source】。\n\n### 结婚的具体案例\n\n一些研究和报道显示，确实有通过Tinder结婚的案例。例如：\n   - Tinder官方报告称，自平台推出以来，已有超过20亿次配对，成千上万的用户报告通过Tinder找到了长期伴侣或结婚对象【32†source】。\n\n### 总结\n\n虽然Tinder和其他约会应用确实帮助许多用户找到了长期伴侣并最终结婚，但总体成功率和结婚概率受到多种因素的影响，包括个人期望、使用方式和平台特点等。因此，尽管有成功案例，但不能保证所有用户都能通过Tinder找到结婚对象。"]},"status":"finished_successfully","end_turn":true,"weight":1,"metadata":{"citations":[{"start_ix":152,"end_ix":163,"citation_format_type":"tether_og","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Key

By contrast, users 50 and older are about five times more likely to use Match than Tinder (50% vs. 11%).\n\n[Image 3: A bar chart showing that about a quarter of partnered LGB adults say they met their match online dating]\n\nOne-in-ten partnered adults – meaning those who are married, living with a partner or in a committed romantic relationship – met their current significant other through a dating site or app. Partnered adults who are under 30 or who are LGB stand out from other groups when looking at this measure of online dating “success”: One-in-five partnered adults under 30 say they met their current spouse or partner on a dating site or app, as do about a quarter of partnered LGB adults (24%).\n\nOnline dating users are somewhat divided over whether their experiences on these platforms have been positive or negative. Among those who have ever used a dating site or app, slightly more say their personal experiences have been very or somewhat positive than say they have been very or somewhat negative (53% vs. 46%).\n\nSome demographic groups are more likely to report positive experiences. For example, 57% of men who have dated online say their experiences have been positive, while women users are roughly split down the middle (48% positive, 51% negative). In addition, LGB users of these platforms are more likely than straight users to report positive experiences (61% vs. 53%).\n\n[Image 4: A bar chart showing that roughly half of online daters say their online dating experiences have been positive, but there are differences by gender and sexual orientation]\n\nRoughly a third of online dating users (35%) say they have ever paid to use one of these platforms – including for extra features – but this varies by income, age and gender. Some 45% of online dating users with upper incomes report having paid to use a dating site or app, compared with 36% of users with middle incomes and 28% of those with lower incomes. Similarly, 41% of users 30 and older say they have paid to use these platforms, compared with 22% of those under 30. Men who have dated online are more likely than women to report having paid for these sites and apps (41% vs. 29%).\n\nThose who have ever paid to use dating sites or apps report more positive experiences than those who have never paid. Around six-in-ten paid users (58%) say their personal experiences with dating sites or apps have been positive; half of users who have never paid say this.\n\n[Image 5: A chart showing that women and men using dating platforms in the past year feel differently about the number of messages they get – women are more likely to be overwhelmed and men are more likely to be insecure]\n\nWomen who have used online dating platforms in the past year are more likely to feel overwhelmed by the number of messages they get, while men are more likely to feel insecure about a lack of messages. Among current or recent online dating users, 54% of women say they have felt overwhelmed by the number of messages they received on dating sites or apps in the past year, while just a quarter of men say the same. By contrast, 64% of men say they have felt insecure because of the lack of messages they received, while four-in-ten women say the same.\n\nOverall, 55% of adults who have used a dating app or site in the past year say they often or sometimes felt insecure about the number of messages they received, while 36% say they often or sometimes felt overwhelmed. \n\nAmong recent online daters, large majorities of men and women say they have often or sometimes felt excited by the people they have seen while using these platforms, though large majorities also say they have often or sometimes felt disappointed.\n\n[Image 6: A chart showing that similar shares of men versus women who have online dated recently say a major reason is to find a partner, dates, friends; men are much more likely than women to name casual sex as a major reason (31% vs. 13%)]\n\nWhen asked why they’ve turned to dating sites or apps in the past year, 44% of users say a major reason was to meet a long-term partner and 40% say a major reason was to date casually. Smaller shares say a major reason was to have casual sex (24%) or make new friends (22%).\n\nMen who have used a dating platform in the past year are much more likely than women to say casual sex was a major reason (31% vs. 13%).

Instead of having a matchmaker rifle through thousands of profiles to find someone unique, users are allowed to decide whether they like someone based off a few photos.\n\nIn comparison to the services which had come before, 【191†Tinder】 made dating simple, but it also, as studies have found, made it less about lasting connections and relationships and more about casual hook-ups and cheesy openers. \n\nTinder was built by Hatch Labs, a startup incubator funded by IAC. At the time, IAC also owned Match.com, Plenty of Fish, and OK Cupid, so by building Tinder, it made its own cannibal, which has eaten away at the market share of others.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n[Image 1][Image 2]\n\n【192†Efficient, Effective User Acquisition Made Easy†links.performcb.com】\n\nWondering how to increase engaged, qualified new users?

Created by Russian entrepreneur Andrey Andreev, Badoo has had many lives, including as a social games and quiz app in Facebook Games heyday in the early 2010s. \n\nBadoo is the most downloaded dating app in the world, with over 400 million registered users, but it has not been able to make a mark in the US. In 2014, Andreev partnered with Tinder co-founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, who left the company after tensions with executives, to found Bumble.\n\nWhere Badoo failed, 【193†Bumble】 succeeded in drawing North American users away from Tinder. Marketed as the feminist dating app, Bumble allows women to make the first move, giving them full control of the experience. \n\nBumble’s growth in the past few years has also marked a change in attitudes towards dating, as people have started to turn away from the casual hook-up culture of Tinder. Hinge, another IAC-owned app, switched its entire platform in 2017 to focus on long term relationships. \n\nThat said, the culture is not devolving back to the Match.com era. Tinder and Badoo are still the leaders in monthly active users, and in emerging markets like China and South-east Asia, casual dating apps are far exceeding long-term services in popularity.\n\nWe have collected data and statistics on the dating app market.

It designed (and patented) the swipe interface, in which a user swipes right to ‘like’ or left to ‘pass’. If two users both like each others, it’s a match, and they are then able to chat through the app.\n\nWhile deciding, Tinder users are able to view selected pictures of their potential match, alongside a short bio and linked Spotify and Instagram accounts if connected.\n\nWith its basis in physical proximity, it dispenses with the complex algorithms utilized by other mobile dating apps and reduces it to the simplest level that you might find in real life: physical attraction. For that reason, Tinder has gained a reputation as a ‘hook-up app’, a reputation that competitors like Bumble have been quick to capitalize on.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n[Image 2][Image 3]\n\n【191†Discover Apple's AdAttributionKit: Revolutionizing Mobile Privacy†www.crowdcast.io】\n\nJoin our expert panel to explore Apple’s new AdAttributionKit.

For example, 57% of men who have dated online say their experiences have been positive, while women users are roughly split down the middle (48% positive, 51% negative). In addition, LGB users of these platforms are more likely than straight users to report positive experiences (61% vs. 53%).\n\n[Image 4: A bar chart showing that roughly half of online daters say their online dating experiences have been positive, but there are differences by gender and sexual orientation]\n\nRoughly a third of online dating users (35%) say they have ever paid to use one of these platforms – including for extra features – but this varies by income, age and gender. Some 45% of online dating users with upper incomes report having paid to use a dating site or app, compared with 36% of users with middle incomes and 28% of those with lower incomes. Similarly, 41% of users 30 and older say they have paid to use these platforms, compared with 22% of those under 30. Men who have dated online are more likely than women to report having paid for these sites and apps (41% vs. 29%).\n\nThose who have ever paid to use dating sites or apps report more positive experiences than those who have never paid. Around six-in-ten paid users (58%) say their personal experiences with dating sites or apps have been positive; half of users who have never paid say this.\n\n[Image 5: A chart showing that women and men using dating platforms in the past year feel differently about the number of messages they get – women are more likely to be overwhelmed and men are more likely to be insecure]\n\nWomen who have used online dating platforms in the past year are more likely to feel overwhelmed by the number of messages they get, while men are more likely to feel insecure about a lack of messages. Among current or recent online dating users, 54% of women say they have felt overwhelmed by the number of messages they received on dating sites or apps in the past year, while just a quarter of men say the same. By contrast, 64% of men say they have felt insecure because of the lack of messages they received, while four-in-ten women say the same.\n\nOverall, 55% of adults who have used a dating app or site in the past year say they often or sometimes felt insecure about the number of messages they received, while 36% say they often or sometimes felt overwhelmed. \n\nAmong recent online daters, large majorities of men and women say they have often or sometimes felt excited by the people they have seen while using these platforms, though large majorities also say they have often or sometimes felt disappointed.\n\n[Image 6: A chart showing that similar shares of men versus women who have online dated recently say a major reason is to find a partner, dates, friends; men are much more likely than women to name casual sex as a major reason (31% vs. 13%)]\n\nWhen asked why they’ve turned to dating sites or apps in the past year, 44% of users say a major reason was to meet a long-term partner and 40% say a major reason was to date casually. Smaller shares say a major reason was to have casual sex (24%) or make new friends (22%).\n\nMen who have used a dating platform in the past year are much more likely than women to say casual sex was a major reason (31% vs. 13%).

It designed (and patented) the swipe interface, in which a user swipes right to ‘like’ or left to ‘pass’. If two users both like each others, it’s a match, and they are then able to chat through the app.\n\nWhile deciding, Tinder users are able to view selected pictures of their potential match, alongside a short bio and linked Spotify and Instagram accounts if connected.\n\nWith its basis in physical proximity, it dispenses with the complex algorithms utilized by other mobile dating apps and reduces it to the simplest level that you might find in real life: physical attraction.

It designed (and patented) the swipe interface, in which a user swipes right to ‘like’ or left to ‘pass’. If two users both like each others, it’s a match, and they are then able to chat through the app.\n\nWhile deciding, Tinder users are able to view selected pictures of their potential match, alongside a short bio and linked Spotify and Instagram accounts if connected.\n\nWith its basis in physical proximity, it dispenses with the complex algorithms utilized by other mobile dating apps and reduces it to the simplest level that you might find in real life: physical attraction. For that reason, Tinder has gained a reputation as a ‘hook-up app’, a reputation that competitors like Bumble have been quick to capitalize on.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n[Image 2][Image 3]\n\n【191†Discover Apple's AdAttributionKit: Revolutionizing Mobile Privacy†www.crowdcast.io】\n\nJoin our expert panel to explore Apple’s new AdAttributionKit.

If two users both like each others, it’s a match, and they are then able to chat through the app.\n\nWhile deciding, Tinder users are able to view selected pictures of their potential match, alongside a short bio and linked Spotify and Instagram accounts if connected.\n\nWith its basis in physical proximity, it dispenses with the complex algorithms utilized by other mobile dating apps and reduces it to the simplest level that you might find in real life: physical attraction. For that reason, Tinder has gained a reputation as a ‘hook-up app’, a reputation that competitors like Bumble have been quick to capitalize on.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n[Image 2][Image 3]\n\n【191†Discover Apple's AdAttributionKit: Revolutionizing Mobile Privacy†www.crowdcast.io】\n\nJoin our expert panel to explore Apple’s new AdAttributionKit.

Sean Rad (former CEO and chairman) and Justin Mateen (former CMO), who had met at the University of Southern California, designed the matchmaking algorithm.\n\nAfter initially being trialed in a series of US college (university) campuses, Tinder was rolled out fully to great success, processing 【192†350 million swipes per day by late 2013†www.forbes.com】 (that’s 4,000 per second), rising to 【193†one billion swipes per day before the end of 2014†www.nytimes.com】.\n\nThe free-to-use app introduced a premium subscription model in 2015 with added features (Tinder Plus), and a third level in 2017 (Tinder Gold). One-off in-app purchases can also be made.\n\nSince then, Tinder has only grown bigger to become an irreducible element in the modern dating landscape. Even with new competition from Bumble in the US and Badoo in Europe, it remains the most popular dating app.\n\nWe have collected data and statistics on Tinder.

Tinder is the top online dating platform among users under 50. By contrast, users 50 and older are about five times more likely to use Match than Tinder (50% vs. 11%).\n\n[Image 3: A bar chart showing that about a quarter of partnered LGB adults say they met their match online dating]\n\nOne-in-ten partnered adults – meaning those who are married, living with a partner or in a committed romantic relationship – met their current significant other through a dating site or app. Partnered adults who are under 30 or who are LGB stand out from other groups when looking at this measure of online dating “success”: One-in-five partnered adults under 30 say they met their current spouse or partner on a dating site or app, as do about a quarter of partnered LGB adults (24%).\n\nOnline dating users are somewhat divided over whether their experiences on these platforms have been positive or negative. Among those who have ever used a dating site or app, slightly more say their personal experiences have been very or somewhat positive than say they have been very or somewhat negative (53% vs. 46%).\n\nSome demographic groups are more likely to report positive experiences. For example, 57% of men who have dated online say their experiences have been positive, while women users are roughly split down the middle (48% positive, 51% negative). In addition, LGB users of these platforms are more likely than straight users to report positive experiences (61% vs. 53%).\n\n[Image 4: A bar chart showing that roughly half of online daters say their online dating experiences have been positive, but there are differences by gender and sexual orientation]\n\nRoughly a third of online dating users (35%) say they have ever paid to use one of these platforms – including for extra features – but this varies by income, age and gender. Some 45% of online dating users with upper incomes report having paid to use a dating site or app, compared with 36% of users with middle incomes and 28% of those with lower incomes. Similarly, 41% of users 30 and older say they have paid to use these platforms, compared with 22% of those under 30. Men who have dated online are more likely than women to report having paid for these sites and apps (41% vs. 29%).\n\nThose who have ever paid to use dating sites or apps report more positive experiences than those who have never paid. Around six-in-ten paid users (58%) say their personal experiences with dating sites or apps have been positive; half of users who have never paid say this.\n\n[Image 5: A chart showing that women and men using dating platforms in the past year feel differently about the number of messages they get – women are more likely to be overwhelmed and men are more likely to be insecure]\n\nWomen who have used online dating platforms in the past year are more likely to feel overwhelmed by the number of messages they get, while men are more likely to feel insecure about a lack of messages. Among current or recent online dating users, 54% of women say they have felt overwhelmed by the number of messages they received on dating sites or apps in the past year, while just a quarter of men say the same. By contrast, 64% of men say they have felt insecure because of the lack of messages they received, while four-in-ten women say the same.\n\nOverall, 55% of adults who have used a dating app or site in the past year say they often or sometimes felt insecure about the number of messages they received, while 36% say they often or sometimes felt overwhelmed. \n\nAmong recent online daters, large majorities of men and women say they have often or sometimes felt excited by the people they have seen while using these platforms, though large majorities also say they have often or sometimes felt disappointed.\n\n[Image 6: A chart showing that similar shares of men versus women who have online dated recently say a major reason is to find a partner, dates, friends; men are much more likely than women to name casual sex as a major reason (31% vs. 13%)]\n\nWhen asked why they’ve turned to dating sites or apps in the past year, 44% of users say a major reason was to meet a long-term partner and 40% say a major reason was to date casually. Smaller shares say a major reason was to have casual sex (24%) or make new friends (22%).\n\nMen who have used a dating platform in the past year are much more likely than women to say casual sex was a major reason (31% vs. 13%). There are no statistically significant gender differences on the other three reasons asked about in the survey.\n\n[Image 7: A pie chart showing that Americans lean toward thinking dating sites and apps make finding a partner easier versus harder, but some","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":33,"search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":211,"end_ix":222,"citation_format_type":"tether_og","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Dating App Revenue and Usage Statistics (2024) - Business of Apps","url":"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/","text":"        * 【147†Sweepstakes】\n        * 【148†Travel】\n        * 【149†Utilities】\n      * 【122†Commission Types】 \n        * 【150†CPA】\n        * 【151†CPC】\n        * 【152†CPI】\n        * 【153†CPL】\n        * 【154†CPM】\n        * 【155†CPS】\n        * 【156†RevShare】\n  * 【3†Insights】 \n    * 【157†App Marketing】\n    * 【158†App Store Optimization】\n    * 【159†User Acquisition】\n    * 【160†App Engagement】\n    * 【161†App Development】\n    * 【162†App Revenue】\n  * 【6†Podcast】 \n    * 【163†App Marketing】\n    * 【164†App Store Optimization】\n    * 【165†User Acquisition】\n    * 【166†App Engagement】\n    * 【167†App Analytics】\n    * 【168†App Revenue】\n    * 【169†Influencer】\n  * 【170†Video】 \n    * 【171†App Marketing】\n    * 【172†App Store Optimization】\n    * 【173†User Acquisition】\n    * 【174†App Engagement】\n    * 【175†Subscriptions】\n    * 【176†Influencer】\n  * 【8†App Data】 \n    * 【177†App Market】\n    * 【178†App Benchmarks】\n    * 【179†App Sectors】\n    * 【180†App Reports】\n    * 【181†App Stats】\n    * 【182†App Rankings】\n  * 【5†Events】 \n    * 【183†APS London†apppromotionsummit.com】\n    * 【184†APS NYC†apppromotionsummit.com】\n    * 【185†APS SF†apppromotionsummit.com】\n    * 【186†APS Berlin†apppromotionsummit.com】\n    * 【187†App Growth Awards†apppromotionsummit.com】\n    * 【7†Webinars】\n  * More \n    * 【188†News \u0026 Announcements】\n    * 【4†Guides】\n    * 【189†App Leaders】\n    * 【13†Downloads】\n\n【14† Subscribe】 【15†Advertise】 \n\n【0†Menu】 \n\n  * 【1†Home】\n  * 【8†App Data】\n  * Dating App Revenue and Usage Statistics (2024)\n\n# Dating App Revenue and Usage Statistics (2024)\n\n[Image 0] \n\n【190†David Curry】\n\nUpdated: June 25, 2024\n\n##### \n\nIn 2013, Tinder revolutionised the online dating industry with a simple system, swipe right if interested, left if not.

Around six-in-ten paid users (58%) say their personal experiences with dating sites or apps have been positive; half of users who have never paid say this.\n\n[Image 5: A chart showing that women and men using dating platforms in the past year feel differently about the number of messages they get – women are more likely to be overwhelmed and men are more likely to be insecure]\n\nWomen who have used online dating platforms in the past year are more likely to feel overwhelmed by the number of messages they get, while men are more likely to feel insecure about a lack of messages. Among current or recent online dating users, 54% of women say they have felt overwhelmed by the number of messages they received on dating sites or apps in the past year, while just a quarter of men say the same. By contrast, 64% of men say they have felt insecure because of the lack of messages they received, while four-in-ten women say the same.\n\nOverall, 55% of adults who have used a dating app or site in the past year say they often or sometimes felt insecure about the number of messages they received, while 36% say they often or sometimes felt overwhelmed. \n\nAmong recent online daters, large majorities of men and women say they have often or sometimes felt excited by the people they have seen while using these platforms, though large majorities also say they have often or sometimes felt disappointed.\n\n[Image 6: A chart showing that similar shares of men versus women who have online dated recently say a major reason is to find a partner, dates, friends; men are much more likely than women to name casual sex as a major reason (31% vs. 13%)]\n\nWhen asked why they’ve turned to dating sites or apps in the past year, 44% of users say a major reason was to meet a long-term partner and 40% say a major reason was to date casually. Smaller shares say a major reason was to have casual sex (24%) or make new friends (22%).\n\nMen who have used a dating platform in the past year are much more likely than women to say casual sex was a major reason (31% vs. 13%). There are no statistically significant gender differences on the other three reasons asked about in the survey.\n\n[Image 7: A pie chart showing that Americans lean toward thinking dating sites and apps make finding a partner easier versus harder, but some","pub_date":null,"extra":{"cited_message_idx":33,"search_result_idx":null,"evidence_text":"source","cloud_doc_url":null}}},{"start_ix":539,"end_ix":550,"citation_format_type":"tether_og","metadata":{"type":"webpage","title":"Dating App Revenue and Usage Statistics (2024) - Business of Apps","url":"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/","text":"        * 【147†Sweepstakes】\n        * 【148†Travel】\n        * 【149†Utilities】\n      * 【122†Commission Types】 \n        * 【150†CPA】\n        * 【151†CPC】\n        * 【152†CPI】\n        * 【153†CPL】\n        * 【154†CPM】\n        * 【155†CPS】\n        * 【156†RevShare】\n  * 【3†Insights】 \n    * 【157†App Marketing】\n    * 【158†App Store Optimization】\n    * 【159†User Acquisition】\n    * 【160†App Engagement】\n    * 【161†App Development】\n    * 【162†App Revenue】\n  * 【6†Podcast】 \n    * 【163†App Marketing】\n    * 【164†App Store Optimization】\n    * 【165†User Acquisition】\n    * 【166†App Engagement】\n    * 【167†App Analytics】\n    * 【168†App Revenue】\n    * 【169†Influencer】\n  * 【170†Video】 \n    * 【171†App Marketing】\n    * 【172†App Store Optimization】\n    * 【173†User Acquisition】\n    * 【174†App Engagement】\n    * 【175†Subscriptions】\n    * 【176†Influencer】\n  * 【8†App Data】 \n    * 【177†App Market】\n    * 【178†App Benchmarks】\n    * 【179†App Sectors】\n    * 【180†App Reports】\n    * 【181†App Stats】\n    * 【182†App Rankings】\n  * 【5†Events】 \n    * 【183†APS London†apppromotionsummit.com】\n    * 【184†APS NYC†apppromotionsummit.com】\n    * 【185†APS SF†apppromotionsummit.com】\n    * 【186†APS Berlin†apppromotionsummit.com】\n    * 【187†App Growth Awards†apppromotionsummit.com】\n    * 【7†Webinars】\n  * More \n    * 【188†News \u0026 Announcements】\n    * 【4†Guides】\n    * 【189†App Leaders】\n    * 【13†Downloads】\n\n【14† Subscribe】 【15†Advertise】 \n\n【0†Menu】 \n\n  * 【1†Home】\n  * 【8†App Data】\n  * Dating App Revenue and Usage Statistics (2024)\n\n# Dating App Revenue and Usage Statistics (2024)\n\n[Image 0] \n\n【190†David Curry】\n\nUpdated: June 25, 2024\n\n##### \n\nIn 2013, Tinder revolutionised the online dating industry with a simple system, swipe right if interested, left if not. Instead of having a matchmaker rifle through thousands of profiles to find someone unique, users are allowed to decide whether they like someone based off a few photos.\n\nIn comparison to the services which had come before, 【191†Tinder】 made dating simple, but it also, as studies have found, made it less about lasting connections and relationships and more about casual hook-ups and cheesy openers. \n\nTinder was built by Hatch Labs, a startup incubator funded by IAC. At the time, IAC also owned Match.com, Plenty of Fish, and OK Cupid, so by building Tinder, it made its own cannibal, which has eaten away at the market share of others.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\n[Image 1][Image 2]\n\n【192†Efficient, Effective User Acquisition Made Easy†links.performcb.com】\n\nWondering how to increase engaged, qualified new users? Get in touch with our team of user acquisition experts to discuss a custom outcome-based strategy.\n\n【192†Learn more†links.performcb.com】\n\nIn the United States, Tinder has ruled the roost since its inception, but in Europe and South America, Badoo has been the frontrunner. Created by Russian entrepreneur Andrey Andreev, Badoo has had many lives, including as a social games and quiz app in Facebook Games heyday in the early 2010s. \n\nBadoo is the most downloaded dating app in the world, with over 400 million registered users, but it has not been able to make a mark in the US. In 2014, Andreev partnered with Tinder co-founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, who left the company after tensions with executives, to found Bumble.\n\nWhere Badoo failed, 【193†Bumble】 succeeded in drawing North American users away from Tinder. Marketed as the feminist dating app, Bumble allows women to make the first move, giving them full control of the experience. \n\nBumble’s growth in the past few years has also marked a change in attitudes towards dating, as people have started to turn away from the casual hook-up culture of Tinder. Hinge, another IAC-owned app, switched its entire platform in 2017 to focus on long term relationships. \n\nThat said, the culture is not devolving back to the Match.com era. Tinder and Badoo are still the leaders in monthly active users, and in emerging markets like China and South-east Asia, casual dating apps are far exceeding long-term services in popularity.\n\nWe have collected data and statistics on the dating app market.
